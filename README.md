# stuff-counter

A Discord bot that counts everything for you, when you don't feel like it!


## Hosting Locally

Setting up the bot is easy, you firstly need to fill in the .env file with a bot token.

```
BOT_TOKEN=...

# optional
TEST_GUILDS=[...] # used for posting commands to certain guilds. Usually for testing
```

Then you can run `docker-compose up` to start the bot.
